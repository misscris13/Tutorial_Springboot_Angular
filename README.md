# What is this?

This is a **public** repository that simply exists to document my ongoing progress in completing a **tutorial** in **Springboot** and **Angular**, offered by Capgemini, where I‚Äôm working right now.

## Things to know about the repo

### Submodules

The repository is **Tutorial_Springboot_Angular**, and it contains **two** submodules: **Backend** and **Frontend**. The names are pretty self-explanatory here. The backend will consist of Java-Springboot, and the frontend of HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Angular.

### Keeping track of progress

As a way of anotating everything and simulating a real project, I'm working on a [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/59992f34dfb947f4a4771ea6462f10a7?v=2436990bd6874431adbefbdd62597465&p=a6744dc2f9334a7ebd11784db7ddc932) that acts similar to a Trello.

### Notation

*üí° The commits will follow this basic structure -
action(affected): description*

**Action**

- feat - created a new feature
- fix - fixed an issue
- style - changed styling
- refactor - refactored a section of the repo
- test - testing
- docs - documentation
- chore - maintenance

**Affected**

The affected can be more or less global.

- If referring to Frontend - **front**
- If referring to Backend - **back**

It could also be more specific, like:

- **css**
- **js**
- ‚Ä¶etc.

**Description**

This will vary more often, depending on how I‚Äôm feeling. However, I will try to keep it fairly similar:

- The first word is a verb in imperative form
- I will keep things as short and explanatory as possible

**Examples**

- docs(project): add README.md
- feat(front): add login form
- style(back): remove commented code

## Anything else?

Not really, no. I will keep updating the code and README, if necessary. See you on the other side.
